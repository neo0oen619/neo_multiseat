# neo_multiseat üéÆüñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏èüñ•Ô∏è

Turn one Windows PC into a comfy **multi‚Äëseat** workstation ‚Äî without weird hacks or yak‚Äëshaving.
Run one PowerShell script, pick a user, and boom: multiple people can use the same machine **at the same time** (via Remote Desktop).

> Heads‚Äëup: Remote Desktop licensing & your company policies still apply. Use this responsibly on systems you own/admin.

## Why though?

Sometimes you‚Äôve got a solid PC and **two (or more) humans**. Pair programming, family PC, quick lab setup‚Ä¶ no need to buy extra boxes when you only need extra *seats*.

---

## Features (no buzzwords, just vibes)

- **One script, one job** ‚Äî a clean menu that guides you end‚Äëto‚Äëend.
- **Pick or create a user** ‚Äî list existing accounts, reset a password, or add a new one.
- **Always creates a `.rdp` file** ‚Äî named after the chosen user *and* timestamp.
- **Supports more than two seats** ‚Äî concurrent sessions for multiple users (people run 3‚Äì5 regularly; **10 can be done** on capable hardware/configs).
- **Works with your fork** ‚Äî downloads and updates from your repo for stability.
- **Auto‚Äëupdates the good stuff** ‚Äî fetches updated config after Windows updates.
- **Built‚Äëin ‚ÄúFix it‚Äù** ‚Äî if RDP gets grumpy, press Fix; the script repairs and retries.
- **Open the folder / delete a user** ‚Äî quick maintenance shortcuts, right in the menu.
- **Polite finish** ‚Äî tells you when to reboot, doesn‚Äôt hold your PC hostage.

> Practical limits depend on CPU/RAM/IO/network and policy. Plan capacity like you would for a small terminal server.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 **Pro/Enterprise**
- Local admin rights
- Internet access (to pull binaries from your fork)
- PowerShell (Windows default is fine)

> Some AV tools may flag wrapper binaries. Add exclusions if you trust your source.

## Quick start

1. **Download** `neo_multiseat.ps1` from the repo root (or **clone** this repo).  
2. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**, then:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\neo_multiseat.ps1
```

3. Choose an option:
   - **Install / Configure extra seats** (the main event)  
   - **Fix RDP** (if Windows updates or configs got spicy)  
   - **Delete a user** (with a big "are you sure?")  
   - **Open the RDP folder** (for the curious)

When done, **reboot once** before testing the extra seats.

## How to connect (super explicit)

- The script **always** creates a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse `.rdp` file when you pick or create a user.
- File name format:  
  `Seat2_<username>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.rdp`
- Where to find it:
  - In the **same folder** as the script
  - On the **Public Desktop** (so it‚Äôs easy for everyone)
- To connect:
  1. Double‚Äëclick the `.rdp` file.
  2. When prompted, enter the password you set in the script for that user.
  3. If you see any warning, read it (responsibly), then continue.

Tip: You can copy the `.rdp` file to another machine and connect across the network (make sure PCs can see each other and ports/firewall are open).

---

## More than two seats? (Yes.)

- **Create/prepare more users**: run **Install / Configure extra seats** again and select a different user each time (or press **N** to create new).  
- Each run drops a fresh `.rdp` file; hand those to your humans.  
- Multiple devices can connect **concurrently** to the same PC using different accounts.  
- **Scaling**: 3‚Äì5 sessions is common on modern hardware; **~10 is possible** if CPU/RAM/network keep up and policies allow it. Monitor Task Manager for bottlenecks.

---

## Troubleshooting (human‚Äëfriendly)

- **"TermService failed to start"**  
  Choose **Fix RDP** in the menu (or accept the "Fix now?" prompt). It will repair things and retry.
- **RDPConf shows red**  
  Run **Fix RDP**, then **Install** again. The script auto‚Äëupdates what it needs.
- **AV blocked something**  
  Check logs and whitelist the RDP Wrapper folder if you trust it.
- **Still stuck?**  
  Reboot once, then rerun the script and pick **Fix ‚Üí Install**.

## Rumor corner: Tailscale üêíüí®

A little bird (okay, an **ape** with suspiciously good Wi‚ÄëFi) whispered that pairing this setup with **Tailscale** makes remote connections feel like a **haunted VPN** ‚Äî nothing on the router moves, but sessions start walking through walls.  
Punchline from the ape: "It just worked ‚Äî and nobody had to sacrifice a router." üçå

*(Translation: If you want easy, secure remote access across the internet without port‚Äëforwarding, Tailscale can help.)*
