# neo_multiseat 🎮🖥️🖥️🖥️

Turn one Windows PC into a comfy **multi‑seat** workstation — without weird hacks or yak‑shaving.
Run one PowerShell script, pick a user, and boom: multiple people can use the same machine **at the same time** (via Remote Desktop).

> **Heads‑up:** Remote Desktop licensing & your company policies still apply. Use this responsibly on systems you own/admin.

## Why though?

Sometimes you’ve got a solid PC and **two (or more) humans**. Pair programming, family PC, quick lab setup… no need to buy extra boxes when you only need extra *seats*.

---

## Features (no buzzwords, just vibes)

- **One script, one job** — a clean menu that guides you end‑to‑end.
- **Pick or create a user** — list existing accounts, reset a password, or add a new one.
- **Always creates a `.rdp` file** — named after the chosen user *and* timestamp.
- **Supports more than two seats** — concurrent sessions for multiple users (people run 3–5 regularly; **10 can be done** on capable hardware/configs).
- **Works with your fork** — downloads and updates from your repo for stability.
- **Auto‑updates the good stuff** — fetches updated config after Windows updates.
- **Built‑in “Fix it”** — if RDP gets grumpy, press Fix; the script repairs and retries.
- **Open the folder / delete a user** — quick maintenance shortcuts, right in the menu.
- **Polite finish** — tells you when to reboot, doesn’t hold your PC hostage.

> Practical limits depend on CPU/RAM/IO/network and policy. Plan capacity like you would for a small terminal server.

## What’s new (add‑ons)

- **Menu Status line** with color‑coded health: **TermService, Port, Wrapper, INI, NLA, TLS, LAN/WAN/TS**, plus recent **auth counts**.
  - Colors: **Green** = good, **Yellow** = attention/disabled/disconnected, **Red** = problem.
  - **WAN**: **Off = Green** (safer); **On = Red** (exposed). **FAIL** count is **Red when > 0**.
- **Network Modes**: **LAN** (allowlisted subnets), **WAN** (strict CIDRs only — avoid `0.0.0.0/0`), **Tailscale** (auto‑detect adapter), and **Advanced** (NLA+TLS, disable NTLMv1, account lockout, Live Monitor, Tailscale helper).
- **Live Monitor**: real‑time view of successful/failed logons with quick filters, GUI grid, and CSV export.
- **Folder layout & files**:
  - `neo_multiseat.ps1` — main script and menus
  - `neo_multiseat.net.json` — network modes config (auto‑created)
  - `neo_multiseat_*.log` — transcript logs per run
  - `*.rdp` — generated connection files (per user)

---

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 **Pro/Enterprise**
- Local admin rights
- Internet access (to pull binaries from your fork)
- PowerShell (Windows default is fine)

> Some AV tools may flag wrapper binaries. Add exclusions if you trust your source.

---

## Quick start

1. **Download** `neo_multiseat.ps1` from the repo root (or **clone** this repo).  
2. **Run PowerShell as Administrator**, then run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\neo_multiseat.ps1
```

3. Choose an option:
   - **Install / Configure extra seats** (the main event)  
   - **Fix RDP** (if Windows updates or configs got spicy)  
   - **Delete a user** (with a big "are you sure?")  
   - **Open the RDP folder** (for the curious)

When done, **reboot once** before testing the extra seats.

## Menu Status

- The banner shows a color‑coded **STATUS** line: **TermService, Port, Wrapper, INI, NLA, TLS, LAN/WAN/TS**, and recent **auth counts**.
- Colors: **Green** = good, **Yellow** = attention/disabled/disconnected, **Red** = problem.
  - **WAN**: **Off = Green** (safer); **On = Red** (exposed).
  - **FAIL** count: **Red when > 0**.

---

## How to connect (super explicit)

- The script **always** creates a ready‑to‑use `.rdp` file when you pick or create a user.
- File name format:  
  `Seat2_<username>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.rdp`
- Where to find it:
  - In the **same folder** as the script
  - On the **Public Desktop** (so it’s easy for everyone)
- To connect:
  1. Double‑click the `.rdp` file.
  2. When prompted, enter the password you set in the script for that user.
  3. If you see any warning, read it (responsibly), then continue.

> Tip: You can copy the `.rdp` file to another machine and connect across the network (make sure PCs can see each other and ports/firewall are open).

---

## Network Modes

- **LAN** — allowlisted local subnets for RDP (default `LocalSubnet`).
- **WAN** — internet exposure; requires a **strict allowlist** (CIDR/IPs). Avoid `Any/0.0.0.0/0`.
- **Tailscale** — access via the Tailscale adapter (if present).
- **Advanced** — NLA+TLS, disable NTLMv1, account lockout, **Live Monitor**, and Tailscale helper.

---

## Live Monitor

- Opens in a new terminal window (**Network Modes → Advanced → [4]**).
- Controls:
  - **R** — RDP‑only filter  
    - Successes: show only `LogonType=10 (RemoteInteractive)`  
    - Failures: include pre‑auth types **10/7/3** so common RDP failures remain visible
  - **S** toggle successes (show/hide **4624**)
  - **K** toggle lockouts (show/hide **4740**)
  - **+ / -** change days window; **L** list on demand; **E** export CSV; **C** clear; **Q** quit
  - **G** opens a GUI grid for the current filtered list (select a row for details)
- Notes:
  - Listing prints only when pressing **L** (by design); streaming honors filters.
  - CSV exports are written to the monitor window’s folder.

## More than two seats? (Yes.)

- **Create/prepare more users**: run **Install / Configure extra seats** again and select a different user each time (or press **N** to create new).  
- Each run drops a fresh `.rdp` file; hand those to your humans.  
- Multiple devices can connect **concurrently** to the same PC using different accounts.  
- **Scaling**: 3–5 sessions is common on modern hardware; **~10 is possible** if CPU/RAM/network keep up and policies allow it. Monitor Task Manager for bottlenecks.

---

## Troubleshooting (human‑friendly)

- **"TermService failed to start"**  
  Choose **Fix RDP** in the menu (or accept the "Fix now?" prompt). It will repair things and retry.
- **RDPConf shows red**  
  Run **Fix RDP**, then **Install** again. The script auto‑updates what it needs.
- **AV blocked something**  
  Check logs and whitelist the RDP Wrapper folder if you trust it.
- **Still stuck?**  
  Reboot once, then rerun the script and pick **Fix → Install**.

## Rumor corner: Tailscale 🐒💨

A little bird (okay, an **ape** with suspiciously good Wi‑Fi) whispered that pairing this setup with **Tailscale** makes remote connections feel like a **haunted VPN** — nothing on the router moves, but sessions start walking through walls.  
Punchline from the ape: "It just worked — and nobody had to sacrifice a router." 🍌

*(Translation: If you want easy, secure remote access across the internet without port‑forwarding, Tailscale can help.)*
