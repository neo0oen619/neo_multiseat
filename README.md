neo_multiseat 🎮🖥️🖥️

Turn one Windows PC into a comfy two‑seat workstation — without weird hacks or yak‑shaving.
Run one PowerShell script, pick a user, and boom: two people can use the same machine at the same time (via Remote Desktop).

Heads‑up: Remote Desktop licensing & your company policies still apply. Use this responsibly on systems you own/admin.

Why though?

Sometimes you’ve got a solid PC and two humans. Pair programming, family PC, quick lab setup… no need to buy a second box when you only need a second seat.

Features (no buzzwords, just vibes)

One script, one job — a clean menu that guides you end‑to‑end.

Pick or create a user — list existing accounts, reset a password, or add a new one.

Always creates a .rdp file — named after the chosen user and timestamp, saved in two convenient locations.

Works with your fork — downloads and updates from your repo for stability.

Auto‑updates the good stuff — fetches updated config after Windows updates.

Built‑in “Fix it” — if RDP goes grumpy, press Fix; the script repairs and retries.

Open the folder / delete a user — quick maintenance shortcuts, right in the menu.

Polite finish — tells you when to reboot, doesn’t hold your PC hostage.

Requirements

Windows 10/11 Pro/Enterprise

Local admin rights

Internet access (to pull binaries from your fork)

PowerShell (Windows default is fine)

Some AV tools may flag wrapper binaries. Add exclusions if you trust your source.

Quick start

Download the script from this repo’s releases or the scripts/ folder.

Run PowerShell as Administrator, then copy/paste this:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\Setup-Seat2-Integrated.ps1


Choose an option from the menu:

Install / Configure Seat 2 (the main event)

Fix RDP (if Windows updates or configs got spicy)

Delete a user (with a big “are you sure?”)

Open the RDP folder (for the curious)

When everything’s done, reboot once before testing the second seat.

How to connect (super explicit)

The script always creates a ready‑to‑use .rdp file when you pick or create the Seat‑2 user.

File name format:

Seat2_<username>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.rdp


Where to find it:

In the same folder as the script.

On the Public Desktop (so it’s easy for everyone).

To connect:

Double‑click the .rdp file.

When prompted, enter the password you set in the script for that user.

If you see any scary warning, read it (responsibly), then continue.

Tip: You can copy the .rdp file to another machine and connect across the network (make sure PCs can see each other and ports/firewall are fine).

Troubleshooting (human‑friendly)

“TermService failed to start” – Choose Fix RDP in the menu (or accept the “Fix now?” prompt). It will repair things and retry.

RDPConf shows red – Run the Fix, then Install again. If it’s still red, update the INI via autoupdate and try once more.

AV blocked something – Check logs and whitelist the RDP Wrapper folder if you trust it.

Still stuck? – Reboot once, then rerun the script and pick Fix → Install.

Rumor corner: Tailscale 🐒💨

A little bird (okay, an ape with suspiciously good Wi‑Fi) whispered that pairing this setup with Tailscale
 makes remote connections feel like a small tail‑wind. Punchline from the ape: “It just worked — and I didn’t even have to climb the router.” 🍌

(Translation: If you want easy, secure remote access across the internet without port‑forwarding, Tailscale can help.)
